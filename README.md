## Summary
In order to determine the winner of the election, I calculated the total votes and percentage votes for each candidate in each county. With three candidates (Carles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane) and three diffrent counties (Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe). This data can be modified for any future candidates. The coding on this analysis will need to be modified by changing the candidates' names, counties, and new data information.
